// Description:
// This question is a variation on the Arithmetic Progression kata

// The following was a question that I received during a technical interview for an entry level software developer position.
//   I thought I'd post it here so that everyone could give it a go:

// You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing.
//   Write a function to find and return this number. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?


function missingNo(nums) {
  const newArr= nums.sort();
  let missing = new Array();

for (let i = 1; i <= newArr.length; i++) {
  if (newArr.indexOf(i) == -1) {
    missing.push(i);
  }
}
  return +missing.toString();
}

with ES6 
function missingNo(nums) {
  return nums.sort((a,b)=>a-b).find((n,i)=> n !== i)-1 || 0
}

function missingNo(nums) {
   let arr=nums.sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
   for(let i=0;i<= arr.length;i++)
       if(i!=arr[i])
           return i;    
}
