// Escape the room
// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game.
// There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

var rooms = {
room1:{name:"Room1 name", description : "Room1 description", completed:"Room1 completed"},
room2:{name:"Room2 name", description : "Room2 description", completed:"Room2 completed"},
room3:{name:"Room3 name", description : "Room3 description", completed:"Room3 completed"},
  
}
